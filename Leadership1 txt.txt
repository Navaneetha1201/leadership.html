    <h2>Qualities of Leadership</h2>
    
    <p>Everybody defines leadership differently but I really like the way John C Maxwell defines leadership,
 ‚ÄúA leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.‚Äù Irrespective of how you define a leader, he or she
 can prove to be a difference maker between success and failure. A good leader has a futuristic vision and knows how to turn his ideas 
into real-world success stories. In this article, we take an in-depth look at some of the important leadership qualities that separate good leaders
 from a bad one.</p>
<p>When it comes to accountability, you need to follow the approach highlighted by Arnold H Glasow when he said, 
‚ÄúA good leader takes little more than his share of the blame and little less than his share of the credit.‚Äù
 Make sure that every one of your subordinates is accountable for what they are doing. If they do well, give them a pat on the back
 but if they struggle, make them realize their mistakes and work together to improve. Holding them accountable for their actions will
 create a sense of responsibility among your subordinates and they will go about the business more seriously.</p>
    
    <p>To be an¬†effective leader, you should be confident enough to ensure that other follow your commands. If you are unsure about your own decisions 
and qualities, then your subordinates will never follow you. As a leader, you have to be oozing with confidence, show some swagger and assertiveness
 to gain the respect of your subordinates. This does not mean that you should be overconfident, but you should at least reflect the degree of 
confidence 
required to ensure that your followers trust you as a leader.</p>

    <p>Here are some of the 	Great Indians:</p>
    <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Indian">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Indian</a>
    <p>List of good characteristics, behavior, action, and thoughts is an exhaustive one and it may not be possible to see them all in one person.

Hence, according to me, everyone in this universe will get on to the shoes of a leader at one or the other situation when life offers 
a circumstance or challenge to face and at that point of time,one does not have any other option to get out of it but to exhibit and
 play a leadership role.


</p>
    <p>When someone has the maximum characteristics from the leadership characteristic list, and if he/she exhibits them through their thoughts, words
 and actions consistently and repeatedly allow what may come, will not only benefits himself but also the surrounding people them, and we can call such 
a person as a ‚ÄòLeader‚Äô. I suppose there is no separate feminine word for a ‚ÄòLeader‚Äô.</p>
<p>Powerful leaders have the ability to shape history, and a select few have the distinction of truly changing the world. Here are five influential
 leaders who did just that.</p>
    <h3>A good leader has the following Characteristics:</h3>
    
    <h2 id="com">Good Communication</h2>
    <p>Until you clearly communicate your vision to your team and tell them the strategy to achieve the goal, it will be very difficult for you
 to get the results you want. Simply put, if you are unable to communicate your message effectively to your team, you can never be a good leader. 
A good communicator can be a good leader. Words have the power to motivate people and make them do the unthinkable. If you use them effectively, you
 can
 also achieve better results.</p>

<h2 id="dec">Decision Making Capabilities</h2>
    <p>Apart from having a futuristic vision, a leader should have the ability to take the right decision at the right time. Decisions taken by leaders
 have a profound impact on masses. A leader should think long and hard before taking a decision but once the decision is taken, stand by it. Although,
 most
 leaders take decisions on their own,¬†but it is highly recommended that you¬†consult key stakeholders¬†before taking a decision. After all, they are the 
ones
 who will benefit or suffer from your decisions.</p>
<h2 id="hum">Humility</h2>
    <p>‚ÄúPride makes us artificial and humility makes us real.‚Äù<em><‚ÄîThomas Merton></em>

How would you feel when you are promoted to leadership status? You will feel proud. A good leader is always selfless and always think about his or her 
followers. That is why the¬†leadership styles¬†most great leaders adopt put lots of emphasis on problem-solving and team dynamics instead of focusing on 
self-promotion.

</p>
    <h2 id="emp">Empowerment</h2>
    <p>You cannot do everything, right. It is important for a leader to focus on key responsibilities while leaving the rest to others. By that, 
I mean empowering your followers and delegating tasks to them. If you continue to micromanage your subordinates, it will develop a lack of trust 
and more importantly, you will not be able to focus on important matters, as you should be. Delegate tasks to your subordinates and see how they perform.
 Provide them with all the resources and support they need to achieve the objective and give them a chance to bear the responsibility.</p>
   <h2 id="ins">Inspire Others</h2>
    <p>Probably the most difficult job for a leader is to persuade others to follow. It can only be possible if you inspire your followers by setting a 
good example. When the going gets tough, they look up to you and see how you react to the situation. If you handle it well, they will follow you. 
As a leader, should think positive and this positive approach should be visible through your actions. Stay calm under pressure and keep the¬†motivation level
 up. As John Quincy Adams puts it, ‚ÄúIf your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.‚Äù If you are
 successful in inspiring your subordinates, you can easily overcome any current and future challenge easily.</p>
    
    <h2 id="emo">Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <p>With emotional intelligence, leaders can control their emotions, which prevents negative emotions from influencing their decision-making skills.
 As a result, they are less likely to make hasty decisions. Moreover, emotionally intelligent leaders are great at understanding the emotions and 
care about the feelings of others. That is not all, leaders who have this leadership quality not only handles conflict in a better way but also play an
 important role in conflict resolution.</p>
<p id="inspire">"Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.""</p>
